### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
System data are provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.
It is to take in raw input to create an interactive and friendly experience in the terminal to present the statistics related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

    Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
    End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
    Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
    Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
    End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
    User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
    Gender
    Birth Year

Python 3, NumPy, and pandas are required to run the files.

### Files used
* bikeshare.py
* new_york_city.csv
* chicago.csv
* washington.csv
